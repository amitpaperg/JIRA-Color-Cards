# JIRA-Color-Cards
**Chrome Extension to Colors jira cards prominently when Card Colors are set on JIRA scrum or kanban boards**

The default [Card Coloring](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile063/jira-agile-user-s-guide/configuring-a-board/configuring-card-colours) for JIRA boards is very subtle and hard to miss. This extension makes the Colors of Cards more promiments and colors the entire card automateically with a lighter shade of the applied color.
